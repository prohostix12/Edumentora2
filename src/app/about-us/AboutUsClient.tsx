          </h2>
          <p>
            When students think about shifting to another college or university, one of the biggest worries is whether their earlier studies will still count. Nobody wants to repeat the same subjects or lose valuable years. This is where choosing the Credit Transfer Institute makes all the difference.

          <p>
            The Credit Transfer Institute gives students a chance to carry their credits from one institution to another without starting the degree all over again. By submitting mark sheets, subject details, and the syllabus of the courses already completed, students can have their past work evaluated. Once the credits are approved, they can continue their studies directly from the right semester.
          </p>
