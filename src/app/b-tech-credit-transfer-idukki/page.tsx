            The B Tech Credit Transfer Idukki program offers a second chance for engineering students who had to pause their studies due to relocation, personal issues, or institutional reasons. Through this system, students can transfer their earned credits from one recognized university to another without losing the progress they’ve already made. In Idukki, several UGC and AICTE-approved universities and learning centers help students complete their B.Tech degree through an easy and transparent credit transfer process.

This system saves both time and money by avoiding repeated coursework and helps maintain academic continuity. For students in Idukki who want to continue their B.Tech studies through flexible modes like distance or online education, this credit transfer program is a convenient solution.
